# SQL Painting Dataset Case Study: Project Summary
This project analyzes a painting dataset to answer key business and data-driven questions. 
The analysis involves museum information, artist data, painting attributes, and sales insights. Below are the questions addressed and the SQL techniques applied:

SQL Functions and Techniques Used
Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, CROSS JOIN for multi-table analysis.
Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK() for ranking and deduplication.
Aggregate Functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN() for calculations.
CTEs: WITH clauses for modular and readable queries.
Subqueries: Used for filtering and comparisons.
String Operations: LIKE, STRING_AGG() for pattern matching and concatenation.
Filters: WHERE, HAVING for data segmentation.
Ordering: ORDER BY for sorting results.
Conditionals: CASE for conditional data classification.
Data Cleanup: Deletion of duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER() in a CTE.

This project efficiently utilizes advanced SQL capabilities to uncover key insights from the dataset.
